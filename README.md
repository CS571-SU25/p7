# Singing Through the City

**Singing Through the City** is an interactive web map that explores the cultural geography of Hong Kong through the lens of Cantonese pop music. Many Canto-pop songs reference specific neighborhoods, landmarks, and streets—this project visualizes those lyrical references as a dynamic, map-based storytelling experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Map of Hong Kong:**
  The core of the site is a map centered on Hong Kong. Each clickable pin marks a place mentioned in a song lyric.

- **Rich Song & Place Pop-ups:**
  Clicking a pin reveals:
  - The lyric (in Chinese and English)
  - Song title and artist
  - Album cover image
  - Link to the song on YouTube
  - A short historical note about the location’s cultural context

- **Filter Controls:**
  Explore the map by artist, district, or decade to discover connections between music and place.

- **Audio Preview on Hover:**
  Hovering over a location plays a short musical sample, giving users a quick taste of the song.

- **User Story Submission / Memory Wall:**
  Visitors can share personal memories related to specific songs or places (if time allows).

- **Landing & About Pages:**
  The site includes a main landing page introducing the project and an About page explaining its background.
