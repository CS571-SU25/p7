          <p>
            This interactive web map explores the cultural geography of Hong Kong
            through the lens of Cantonese pop music. Many Canto-pop songs reference
            specific neighborhoods, landmarks, and streetsâ€”this project visualizes
            those lyrical references as a dynamic, map-based storytelling experience.

          <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
          <p>
            Cantonese pop music has long been a reflection of Hong Kong's urban
            identity and social changes. Songs often reference specific locations
            that hold cultural, historical, or personal significance to both
            artists and listeners.
